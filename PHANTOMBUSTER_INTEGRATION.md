## üõ°Ô∏è Trust & Verification System

### **Trust Score Components (0.0 - 1.0)**
- **Profile Completeness (20%)**: Completeness of social profiles
- **Activity Consistency (25%)**: Consistent professional activity patterns
- **Network Quality (15%)**: Professional network strength and authenticity
- **Content Authenticity (20%)**: Quality and authenticity of shared content
- **Cross-Platform Consistency (20%)**: Consistency across LinkedIn and GitHub

### **Verification Statuses**
- **üü¢ Verified**: Trust score ‚â• 0.8, no risk indicators
- **üü° Needs Review**: Trust score ‚â• 0.6, ‚â§ 1 risk indicator
- **üî¥ Unverified**: Trust score < 0.6, multiple risk indicators

### **Risk Indicators**
- `cross-platform-inconsistency`: Discrepancies between social profiles
- `low-professional-activity`: Limited recent professional social activity
- `authenticity-concerns`: Profile authenticity requires verification
- `timeline-discrepancies`: Employment timeline inconsistencies
- `network-anomalies`: Unusual network patterns or connections

## üé® Enhanced Personalization

### **Social Context in AI Interviews**
```python
# LinkedIn-informed questions
"I see from your LinkedIn that you've been leading ML projects at TechCorp. 
Tell me about the most challenging model deployment you've overseen."

# GitHub-informed technical probing  
"Your GitHub shows significant contributions to open-source ML libraries. 
How do you balance open-source work with proprietary projects?"

# Cross-platform verification
"Your LinkedIn mentions 5 years at DataCorp, but I don't see corresponding 
activity in your GitHub from that period. Can you walk me through your role there?"
```

### **Trust-Informed Scoring**
```python
# Enhanced role fit calculation
enhanced_role_fit = (
  technical_skills_match * 0.25 +      # From resume + GitHub analysis
  linkedin_experience_match * 0.25 +   # From LinkedIn professional details
  github_contribution_quality * 0.20 + # From PhantomBuster GitHub analysis
  social_trust_score * 0.15 +          # Cross-platform trust verification
  network_quality_score * 0.15         # Professional network assessment
)
```
