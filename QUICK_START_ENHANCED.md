## 📊 Enhanced Workflow

### **Old Flow (5 questions, no waiting):**
```
Create Person → Extend Profile → Start Interview → 5 Generic Questions → Basic Score
```

### **New Enhanced Flow (8-15 adaptive questions):**
```
Create Person → Extend Profile → [Wait for Enrichment] → Comprehensive Analysis → 
Adaptive Interview Plan → 8-15 Contextual Questions → Advanced Multi-factor Scoring
```

## 🧪 Testing the Enhanced Features

### **1. Test Enhanced Enrichment Tracking**
```python
# Monitor real-time progress
import requests
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/sajilo/person/123/enrichment-status")
status = response.json()

print(f"Enrichment Stage: {status['progress']['stage']}")
print(f"Progress: {status['progress']['progress_percentage']:.1%}")  
print(f"Interview Ready: {status['interview_readiness']['ready']}")
print(f"Profile Completeness: {status['profile_completeness']:.3f}")
```

### **2. Test Adaptive Interview**
```python
# Start adaptive interview
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/sajilo/interview/123/start")
interview = response.json()

print(f"Planned Questions: {interview['interview_metadata']['total_planned_questions']}")
print(f"Focus Areas: {interview['interview_metadata']['focus_areas']}")
print(f"AI Greeting: {interview['agent_reply']}")

# Continue with adaptive responses
continue_response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/sajilo/interview/123/continue",
    json={"message": "Detailed technical response with specific examples..."}
)
```

### **3. Check Comprehensive Insights**
```python
# Get enhanced candidate profile
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/sajilo/candidate/123/full")
profile = response.json()

print(f"Enhanced Depth Score: {profile['signals']['depth_score']:.3f}")
print(f"Consistency Score: {profile['signals']['consistency_score']:.3f}")
print(f"Motivation Alignment: {profile['signals']['motivation_alignment']:.3f}")
print(f"Final Fit Score: {profile['score']['fit_score']:.3f}")
```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### **Adaptive Interview Settings** (in `services/adaptive_interview_engine.py`):
```python
min_questions = 8      # Minimum questions
max_questions = 15     # Maximum questions

question_categories = {
    'technical_depth': {'weight': 0.3, 'min': 2, 'max': 5},
    'experience_validation': {'weight': 0.25, 'min': 2, 'max': 4}, 
    'motivation_alignment': {'weight': 0.2, 'min': 1, 'max': 3},
    'behavioral_assessment': {'weight': 0.15, 'min': 1, 'max': 2},
    'culture_fit': {'weight': 0.1, 'min': 1, 'max': 2}
}
```

### **Enhanced Scoring Weights** (in `config.py`):
```python
SCORING_WEIGHTS = {
    "role_fit": 0.35,                    # Job-specific technical alignment
    "capability_depth": 0.20,            # Advanced depth analysis  
    "motivation_alignment": 0.15,        # Multi-source motivation
    "reliability_inverse_turnover": 0.15, # Turnover risk assessment
    "data_confidence": 0.15              # Profile completeness
}
```

## 🎉 Success Indicators

Your enhanced system is working correctly when you see:

✅ **Enrichment Progress**: Real-time percentage updates  
✅ **Interview Readiness**: "Ready for comprehensive interview" status  
✅ **Adaptive Questions**: 8+ contextual questions with categories  
✅ **Enhanced Scores**: Non-mock consistency and depth scores  
✅ **Comprehensive Insights**: 9-factor analysis results  
✅ **Progress Tracking**: Live updates during enrichment  

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Interview won't start**
- **Check**: Enrichment status at `/person/{id}/enrichment-status`
- **Solution**: Wait for `ready_for_interview: true` or `stage: completed`

### **Issue: Questions seem generic**  
- **Check**: Comprehensive insights at enrichment status endpoint
- **Solution**: Ensure PhantomBuster enrichment completed successfully

### **Issue: Scoring seems too low/high**
- **Check**: Enhanced depth and consistency analysis in signals
- **Solution**: Review candidate responses for technical sophistication

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test Real Candidates**: Use the enhanced flow with actual candidate data
2. **Monitor Performance**: Check scoring accuracy improvements
3. **Customize Questions**: Modify question templates in `adaptive_interview_engine.py`
4. **Tune Weights**: Adjust scoring weights in `config.py` based on hiring outcomes
